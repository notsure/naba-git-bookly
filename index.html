                    Automatically add some description to your pull request
                </h2>

                <p>
                    If you are using <a href="http://github.com" target="_blank">Github</a>
                    to manage your project, either for business or private, you all already
                    had to make a pull request. If you don't know what github or a pull request
                    is, leave this page, this is none of your business!
                </p>

                <h3>What does the script do?</h3>

                <p>
                    When ever I have to make a pull request for work it has to follow some styling
                    guidelines. For example we started to always add a <b>Task</b> and an <b>Information</b>
                    sector in the pull requests description. This helps to remember what needs
                    to be done and helps the reviewer to understand what the pull request is about.
                </p>

                <h4>A proper pull request would look like this</h4>
                <p>
                    <img class="img-thumbnail" src="/images/proper-pullrequest.png" title="This is how a pull request should look like"/>
                </p>

                <h4>However this is how a pull request usually looks like</h4>
                <p>
                    <img class="img-thumbnail" src="/images/shitty-pullrequest.png" title="This is how a pull request should look like"/>
                </p>

                <p>
                    As you can see it looks pretty shitty and a you are giving the reviewer
                    a hard time by not formatting your pull request. If there is only one single
                    pull request in your lifetime you probably do not need to change anything, as
                    you will love to describe the reviewer what you've done there. However for those of
                    you who have to create dozens of pull requests every day it is pretty annoying
                    to format the pull requests every single time.
                </p>

                <h3>The Solution</h3>

                <p>
                    The copy 'n' past time is over! Add this bookmark to your brower to automatically
                    add the base structure to your pull request. All you need to do is change the
                    tasks you have done. Save time, conserve your keyboard.

                    <p style="text-align:center;">
                    <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Simply Drag'n'Drop this bookmark in your browsers bookmarks bar" class="btn btn-primary info-tool" href="javascript:var text;if(window.location.href.match("github.com"))if(window.location.href.match("/compare/")){$(".js-quick-submit")||$(".js-details-target").click(),text="** NabaGitBookly **\nPlease enter a title for you pull request.\n\nYou may want to use some of these prefixes:\n[WIP] \n[FEATURE] \n[BUGFIX] \n[HOTFIX] \n[EXPERIMENTAL]";var pullRequestTitle=prompt(text,$("#pull_request_title").val());pullRequestTitle&&$("#pull_request_title").val(pullRequestTitle),text="__Tasks:__\n- [x] done\n- [ ] todo\n- [ ] got feedback\n\n__Informations:__\n\n| Q             | A\n| ------------- | ---\n| Bug fix?      | no\n| New feature?  | yes\n| Tests pass?   | yes\n| Fixed tickets | none\n| Doc           | none\n",$(".js-quick-submit").html(text),$(".composer-submit").click()}else text="** NabaGitBookly **\nThis fancy script currently only works on new pull requests!",alert(text);else{text="** NabaGitBookly **\nWoops sorry this script only works on a www.github.com pull-request page.\n\nDo you want me to redirect you to:\n http://www.github.com?";var redirect=confirm(text);redirect&&(window.location.href="http://www.github.com")}">
                        <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-bookmark"></span>
                        Bookmark me!
                    </a>
                    </p>
                </p>

                <h3>How it Works</h3>

                <p>
                    Make the changes you need in your project. Publish and push your branch.
                    Visit Github and click on your branch and make a pull request. Now click the
                    bookmark. Thats it.
                </p>
